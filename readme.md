## Why

On **24th May 2025**, I was organizing a tech event.  
During the closing notes, I thought it would be helpful to display the social links of our **speakers and sponsors** on the screen, so the audience could easily access them.

But I hit a roadblock — I couldn’t find a **free QR generator** that fit all my needs.

So yaa, here I am **making?made my own**.


- ## Timeline(2025)
    - ### 24th May - ran into the problem
    - ### 25th May - writing down the features I have to make
        - a qr generator.
        - should be dynamic - can be edited even when the qr is generated.
        - traffic monitoring.
        - auto-detects link type and suggests optimal display.
